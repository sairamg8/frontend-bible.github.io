# ⚡ Vite Core Architecture: The Dual-Engine Model

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

Vite's speed comes from using **two entirely different engines for two entirely different jobs** — never bundling during development at all, and using a fast, purpose-built bundler (Rollup) only for the final production build.

```
DEVELOPMENT                                          PRODUCTION BUILD
        │                                                    │
        ▼                                                    ▼
Native ESM served over HTTP                       Rollup-based bundling
  - browser requests each module directly            - full tree-shaking via static ESM analysis
  - Vite transforms ON DEMAND, per-file,                - code-splitting, chunk optimization
    only files the browser actually requests             - minification, CSS extraction
  - esbuild pre-bundles node_modules deps               - esbuild used for fast per-file transpilation
    (CommonJS/UMD → ESM, flattened graphs)                 WITHIN the Rollup pipeline, not for bundling itself
```

### Why No Dev-Time Bundling Is Fast
A traditional bundler-based dev server (webpack-dev-server, etc.) must build a dependency graph and produce **some** bundle before the browser can load anything — as an app grows, that initial bundling step (and every rebuild after a file change) gets slower in rough proportion to the app's total size. Vite instead serves each module as its own native ESM `import` over HTTP; the browser's own module resolution requests exactly the files the current page needs, and Vite transforms **only those files, on demand** — startup time stays roughly constant regardless of how large the rest of the untouched application is.

### esbuild Pre-Bundling: Solving Two Problems at Once
Native ESM `import` in the browser works fine for the app's own source, but two problems remain for `node_modules` dependencies: (1) many packages still ship as CommonJS/UMD, which the browser can't `import` natively at all, and (2) some packages internally split their exports across dozens or hundreds of small ESM files, which would mean dozens of separate HTTP requests just to load one logical dependency. `optimizeDeps` (Vite's esbuild-powered pre-bundling step) runs once at cold start, converting CommonJS/UMD deps to ESM and flattening each dependency's internal module graph into a single, consolidated ESM file — esbuild's Go-based implementation does this 10-100x faster than an equivalent JS-based bundler would.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Large Application Where Dev Server Startup Went From 45 Seconds to Under 1 Second.
Migrating a large React app from a webpack-dev-server setup to Vite cut cold dev-server start from ~45 seconds to under 1 second, and file-change rebuild time from several seconds to near-instant — not because Vite is doing less total work over the life of a dev session, but because it defers almost all of that work to be **on-demand, per-file**, rather than upfront, whole-app bundling. The team's mental model shift: Vite's dev server isn't a "faster bundler," it fundamentally isn't bundling most of the app at all during development.

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```typescript
// vite.config.ts — the dual-engine split is largely invisible to app code, but explicit
// in what each config section actually configures
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()], // dev: Fast Refresh via esbuild-transformed files; build: a Rollup plugin
  optimizeDeps: {
    // Forces these into esbuild's pre-bundling step even if not auto-detected —
    // useful for deps with unusual export conditions esbuild's scanner might miss
    include: ['some-legacy-commonjs-package'],
  },
  build: {
    // This section configures ROLLUP specifically — a genuinely different engine
    // from the dev server's esbuild-based transform pipeline
    rollupOptions: {
      output: { manualChunks: { vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'] } },
    },
  },
});
```

```bash
# Observing the two engines directly
vite          # dev server — native ESM + esbuild pre-bundling, NO Rollup bundling happens here at all
vite build    # production build — Rollup bundles everything into optimized, tree-shaken chunks
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Assuming Dev and Production Builds Use Identical Transform Behavior
```
❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION: because both dev and build "use esbuild somewhere," code that behaves
one way in `vite` (dev) is assumed to behave IDENTICALLY in `vite build` (production) —
but dev serves UNBUNDLED ESM while build produces BUNDLED, tree-shaken, chunked output.
A bug that only reproduces in production (after `vite build`) often traces back to
something Rollup's bundling/tree-shaking does differently from esbuild's dev-time
per-file transforms — always verify a fix against an ACTUAL production build, not just
the dev server, before considering an issue resolved.
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: A Dependency Missing From `optimizeDeps.include`, Causing Constant Re-Bundling
```typescript
// ❌ SYMPTOM: the dev server keeps re-triggering "new dependencies optimized" and a full page
// reload, repeatedly, for a dependency Vite's automatic scanner didn't discover upfront
// (common with deps only imported conditionally, or via a dynamic path)

// ✅ FIX: explicitly list it so it's included in the INITIAL pre-bundling pass
export default defineConfig({
  optimizeDeps: { include: ['dynamically-imported-dep'] },
});
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Expecting Native ESM Dev Serving to Work Identically in Every Browser
Native ESM `import` serving during development relies on the browser's own module resolution — this requires a genuinely modern browser; Vite's dev server is not meant to be tested for legacy-browser compatibility directly (that's what `@vitejs/plugin-legacy`'s differential bundling handles specifically for the **production build**, not the dev experience). Assuming dev-server behavior is representative of legacy-browser production behavior is a mismatch between two different concerns.
