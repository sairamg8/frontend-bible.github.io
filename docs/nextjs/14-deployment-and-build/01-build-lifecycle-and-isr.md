# ▲ Deployment & Build: `next build` Lifecycle & Incremental Static Regeneration

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

`next build` performs several distinct phases in sequence, and understanding each is what makes ISR's behavior (and its occasional surprises) predictable rather than mysterious.

```
next build
        │
        ├── 1. Compile: TypeScript/JSX → JS, bundling, minification (via the Rust-based compiler, SWC)
        │
        ├── 2. Collect Page Data: run generateStaticParams()/getStaticPaths() to enumerate every
        │       static path that needs pre-rendering
        │
        ├── 3. Prerender: execute each static route's Server Components/getStaticProps,
        │       producing HTML + an RSC payload PER ROUTE, cached as the Full Route Cache's initial contents
        │
        └── 4. Generate Route Manifest: a map of every route → its rendering strategy
              (static / dynamic / ISR-revalidate-after-N-seconds), used by the server at runtime
              to know how to handle each incoming request without re-deriving this per-request
```

### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR): Revalidating Without a Full Rebuild
ISR lets individually static pages refresh **after deployment**, without requiring `next build` to run again for the whole site — either time-based (`revalidate: N` — the next request after N seconds triggers a background regeneration, serving the *stale* version to that request while the fresh one computes, then serving fresh to subsequent requests) or on-demand (`revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath`, called from a Server Action or a webhook-triggered Route Handler, purging a specific cached entry immediately rather than waiting for its time window).

### `fallback` Behavior for Paths Not Known at Build Time
A path not included in `generateStaticParams()`'s returned list isn't necessarily a 404 — depending on configuration, Next.js can generate it **on first request** (`fallback: 'blocking'` in Pages Router terms — the App Router equivalent handles this automatically for dynamic segments not statically enumerated), caching the result for every subsequent request to that same path, effectively lazily expanding the set of pre-rendered pages post-deploy.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: An E-Commerce Catalog With 500,000 Products Where Pre-Rendering All of Them at Build Time Would Take Hours.
Rather than having `generateStaticParams()` return all 500,000 product IDs (making every deploy take unacceptably long), the build pre-renders only the top 1,000 best-selling products explicitly. Every other product ID is generated **on-demand** on its first real visit (lazily, via the fallback/dynamic-segment mechanism), then cached exactly like a build-time-generated page for all subsequent visitors — keeping deploys fast while still ultimately statically caching every product that actually receives traffic, without ever having pre-rendered the long tail of products nobody visits.

---

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```tsx
// app/products/[id]/page.tsx
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  // Only pre-render the top sellers at BUILD time — keeps `next build` fast
  const topSellers = await fetch('https://api.acme.com/products/top-sellers').then((r) => r.json());
  return topSellers.map((p: { id: string }) => ({ id: p.id }));
}

// Any product NOT in the above list is rendered on its FIRST real request, then cached identically
export const dynamicParams = true; // (default) — allow on-demand generation for params outside the static list

async function getProduct(id: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.acme.com/products/${id}`, {
    next: { tags: [`product-${id}`], revalidate: 3600 }, // time-based fallback refresh, even for on-demand-generated pages
  });
  return res.json();
}

export default async function ProductPage({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {
  const { id } = await params;
  const product = await getProduct(id);
  if (!product) return notFound();
  return <ProductView product={product} />;
}
```

```typescript
// app/api/webhooks/inventory-updated/route.ts — on-demand ISR triggered by an external system
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { productId, secret } = await request.json();
  if (secret !== process.env.REVALIDATE_SECRET) {
    return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });
  }
  revalidateTag(`product-${productId}`); // purges the Data Cache immediately — no waiting for the 3600s window
  return Response.json({ revalidated: true });
}
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Returning Every Possible Param From `generateStaticParams()` Regardless of Scale
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: for a catalog with hundreds of thousands of products, this makes `next build`
// itself extremely slow (and the resulting deploy artifact enormous) for the long tail of
// products that receive negligible traffic
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const allProducts = await fetch('https://api.acme.com/products/all').then((r) => r.json());
  return allProducts.map((p) => ({ id: p.id })); // hundreds of thousands of entries
}

// ✅ CORRECT: pre-render only high-traffic paths explicitly; let the long tail generate on-demand
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const topSellers = await fetch('https://api.acme.com/products/top-sellers').then((r) => r.json());
  return topSellers.map((p) => ({ id: p.id })); // a few hundred/thousand, not everything
}
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Assuming a Time-Based `revalidate` Update Is Instant
```typescript
// ❌ MISUNDERSTANDING: revalidate: 3600 does NOT mean "this page updates automatically every
// hour on a timer" — it means "the NEXT request after 3600s elapses triggers a background
// regeneration, and THAT SPECIFIC request still gets served the stale version while it computes"
next: { revalidate: 3600 }

// ✅ CORRECT understanding: for content that must update at a PRECISE moment (not "eventually,
// on next traffic"), use on-demand revalidation (revalidateTag/revalidatePath) triggered by
// the actual event that should cause the update, rather than relying on time-based revalidate alone
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Forgetting `output: 'standalone'` Still Requires `node_modules` Tracing Verification
The `standalone` output mode automatically traces and includes only the dependencies actually used at runtime — but native/binary dependencies (certain database drivers, image processing libraries with native bindings) occasionally aren't traced correctly by default, silently missing from the standalone bundle and only surfacing as a runtime "module not found" error in the deployed container, never at build time. Verify a `standalone` build's actual runtime behavior in a container matching the production environment, not just that `next build` completed without errors.
