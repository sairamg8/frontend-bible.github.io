# ▲ Advanced Patterns: Composition Boundaries, Granular Streaming & Error Hierarchy

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

The advanced patterns in a mature App Router codebase are less about new APIs and more about **deliberate placement** of the boundaries already covered elsewhere in this bible — where exactly `'use client'` starts, where `<Suspense>` boundaries are drawn, and how `error.tsx` boundaries nest.

### Pushing `'use client'` As Deep As Possible
Since the client boundary propagates to everything imported beneath it (see [rendering strategies](../03-rendering-strategies/01-server-client-components-and-rendering-modes.md)), placing `'use client'` at a **high**, coarse level (e.g. an entire page) forces the ENTIRE subtree into the client bundle — even server-only-capable child components that never actually needed interactivity. Pushing the boundary down to the **smallest** actually-interactive leaf component (a single button, a single form) keeps everything else in that subtree as zero-client-JS Server Components.

### Granular Streaming: Multiple Independent `<Suspense>` Boundaries
A single page can have several **independent** Suspense boundaries at different nesting levels, each streaming in as soon as *its own* data resolves — rather than one boundary around the whole page (which would mean the slowest single piece of data blocks everything behind that one boundary from ever streaming early).

### Error Boundary Hierarchy: `error.tsx` vs `global-error.tsx`
`error.tsx` catches errors within its own segment and below, but explicitly **not** errors in its own segment's `layout.tsx` (which must be caught by a parent's `error.tsx`). `global-error.tsx` (at the app root) is the boundary of last resort — it must render its **own** complete `<html>`/`<body>` tags, since it replaces the ENTIRE root layout when triggered, catching even errors the root layout itself throws.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Dashboard Page With Independently-Loading Widgets, Minimal Client JS, and Isolated Failure Domains.
A dashboard renders a static header, a slow revenue chart (needs its own loading state), a slow activity feed (needs its own, separately-timed loading state), and one small interactive "refresh" button. Structuring this with `'use client'` on ONLY the refresh button (not the whole page), two separate `<Suspense>` boundaries around the chart and activity feed (so a slow chart doesn't block the activity feed from streaming in first if it resolves faster), and a dedicated `error.tsx` scoped to just the chart's segment (so a chart data failure shows "chart unavailable" without taking down the entire dashboard) — composes several previously-covered primitives into one page that ships minimal client JS, streams progressively, and fails narrowly.

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```tsx
// app/dashboard/page.tsx — composition: mostly Server Components, ONE small client leaf
import { Suspense } from 'react';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardHeader /> {/* Server Component — static, zero client JS */}

      <Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}>
        <RevenueChart /> {/* streams independently once ITS data resolves */}
      </Suspense>

      <Suspense fallback={<FeedSkeleton />}>
        <ActivityFeed /> {/* streams independently — doesn't wait on RevenueChart */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// app/dashboard/(chart-error-boundary)/RevenueChart.tsx — narrowly-scoped error isolation
// (conceptually: RevenueChart's OWN error.tsx lives alongside it if it's its own route segment;
// for a component-level boundary within one page, a manual error boundary component works too)
async function RevenueChart() {
  const data = await fetch('https://api.acme.com/revenue', { next: { revalidate: 300 } });
  if (!data.ok) throw new Error('Revenue data unavailable'); // caught by the nearest error.tsx UP the tree
  return <ChartView data={await data.json()} />;
}
```

```tsx
// components/RefreshButton.tsx — the ONLY client boundary on this entire page
'use client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export function RefreshButton() {
  const router = useRouter();
  return <button onClick={() => router.refresh()}>Refresh</button>; // tiny client bundle — just this
}
```

```tsx
// app/global-error.tsx — the boundary of last resort; MUST render its own <html>/<body>
'use client';

export default function GlobalError({ error, reset }: { error: Error; reset: () => void }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <h2>A critical error occurred.</h2>
        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: A Single `'use client'` at the Page Level "For Convenience"
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: marking the WHOLE page client-side because ONE button needs onClick forces every
// server-capable child (header, chart, feed) into the client JS bundle unnecessarily
'use client';
export default function DashboardPage() {
  return (<div><DashboardHeader /><RevenueChart /><RefreshButton /></div>);
}

// ✅ CORRECT: keep the page a Server Component; isolate 'use client' to the actual interactive leaf
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: One Suspense Boundary Wrapping Multiple Independent Slow Sections
```tsx
// ❌ SUBOPTIMAL: the FASTER activity feed can't stream in until the SLOWER chart also resolves,
// since they share one boundary — the slowest piece gates everything behind that one boundary
<Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
  <RevenueChart />
  <ActivityFeed />
</Suspense>

// ✅ CORRECT: separate boundaries let each section stream in independently, as soon as ITS data is ready
<Suspense fallback={<ChartSkeleton />}><RevenueChart /></Suspense>
<Suspense fallback={<FeedSkeleton />}><ActivityFeed /></Suspense>
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Expecting a Segment's Own `error.tsx` to Catch Its Sibling `layout.tsx`'s Errors
```
❌ WRONG ASSUMPTION: app/dashboard/error.tsx catches errors from app/dashboard/page.tsx AND
app/dashboard/layout.tsx equally — it does NOT catch layout.tsx's own errors, only page.tsx
and further-nested children's errors

✅ CORRECT: an error thrown inside layout.tsx must be caught by the PARENT segment's error.tsx
(or global-error.tsx at the root) — keep layouts free of risky data-fetching logic where possible,
or ensure the parent segment's error boundary genuinely covers that failure mode
```
