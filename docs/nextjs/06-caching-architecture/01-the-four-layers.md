# ▲ Caching Architecture: The Four Layers

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

Next.js's caching is frequently the single most misunderstood part of the framework precisely because it operates as **four distinct, independently-invalidated layers** — a bug is often "the wrong layer was invalidated," not "caching is broken."

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Request Memoization  — per-render, in-memory, React cache()   │
│    Scope: ONE server render pass. Deduplicates identical fetch()  │
│    calls made by different components during the SAME request.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 2. Data Cache            — persistent, cross-request, cross-deploy  │
│    Scope: EVERY request, forever, until revalidated. This is what    │
│    `fetch(url, { next: { revalidate, tags } })` actually controls.     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 3. Full Route Cache      — static HTML + RSC payload, per ROUTE       │
│    Scope: the rendered OUTPUT of a route, generated at build/ISR time. │
│    Depends on the Data Cache underneath it, but caches the FINAL        │
│    rendered result, not just the raw fetched data.                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 4. Router Cache (Client) — in-browser, per SESSION                       │
│    Scope: visited/prefetched RSC payloads cached in the browser's         │
│    memory for instant back/forward navigation — NOT invalidated by         │
│    server-side revalidatePath/revalidateTag automatically.                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why Four Layers, Not One
Each layer solves a genuinely different problem: (1) avoids redundant network calls **within** one render; (2) avoids redundant network calls **across** requests/time; (3) avoids redundant **rendering work** (not just fetching) for a whole route; (4) avoids redundant **network round-trips to the server at all** for a client that already has the data from a recent visit. Invalidating layer 2 (a `revalidateTag` call) does not automatically invalidate layer 4 (the client's already-cached Router Cache entry) — this exact gap is the single most common "why isn't my data updating" production question in App Router codebases.

### Layer 4 Specifically: The Router Cache's Own Invalidation Rules
The client Router Cache persists visited-route RSC payloads for a default duration (30 seconds for dynamic segments, 5 minutes for static ones, as of recent Next.js versions) **regardless** of server-side revalidation — a `router.refresh()` call (or a full page reload) is what forces the client to discard its own cached payload and re-request fresh RSC output from the server.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Server Action Correctly Revalidating Data on the Server, But the User Still Sees Stale Content.
A "mark as read" Server Action correctly calls `revalidateTag('notifications')`, and a fresh request to that route confirms the Data Cache is genuinely updated server-side. Yet the user, who had the notifications page open in a background tab from 20 seconds earlier, navigates back to it via the browser's back button and sees the stale, unread state — because the client's Router Cache still holds the RSC payload from their earlier visit, and `revalidateTag` only invalidated the **server-side** Data Cache layer, never touching the client's own cached copy. The fix: pairing the Server Action's `revalidateTag` with a client-side `router.refresh()` call (or navigating via a Link that forces a fresh fetch) at the point the mutation completes.

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```tsx
// app/notifications/actions.ts
'use server';
import { revalidateTag } from 'next/cache';

export async function markAsRead(notificationId: string) {
  await fetch(`https://api.acme.com/notifications/${notificationId}/read`, { method: 'POST' });
  revalidateTag('notifications'); // invalidates layer 2 (Data Cache) — server-side only
}
```

```tsx
// components/NotificationItem.tsx — ALSO forcing the client Router Cache (layer 4) to refresh
'use client';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';
import { markAsRead } from '../app/notifications/actions';

export function NotificationItem({ notification }: { notification: Notification }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  async function handleMarkAsRead() {
    await markAsRead(notification.id);
    router.refresh(); // forces the CLIENT to discard its Router Cache entry and re-fetch fresh RSC payload
  }

  return (
    <div onClick={handleMarkAsRead} className={notification.read ? 'opacity-50' : ''}>
      {notification.message}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// Fetching with all three server-side layers deliberately in mind
async function getNotifications(userId: string) {
  // Layer 1 (Request Memoization): identical calls elsewhere in this SAME render reuse this result
  // Layer 2 (Data Cache): tagged for on-demand invalidation, time-based fallback refresh
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.acme.com/notifications?user=${userId}`, {
    next: { tags: ['notifications'], revalidate: 60 },
  });
  return res.json();
}
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Assuming `revalidateTag`/`revalidatePath` Updates the Client Immediately Everywhere
```tsx
// ❌ WRONG: this ONLY invalidates server-side layers (2 and 3) — any client with this route
// already in its Router Cache (layer 4) keeps showing the OLD payload until ITS OWN cache
// naturally expires or a router.refresh()/hard navigation forces a re-fetch
revalidateTag('notifications'); // alone, in a Server Action

// ✅ CORRECT: pair server-side revalidation with a client-side refresh when the SAME session
// needs to see the update immediately (not just future visitors/requests)
revalidateTag('notifications');
// ...and separately, client-side: router.refresh();
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Confusing "Static Route" With "Never Refetches Data"
A statically-rendered route (Full Route Cache, layer 3) still depends on the Data Cache (layer 2) underneath it — a `revalidate: 60` on the underlying `fetch()` means the route's cached HTML itself gets regenerated in the background roughly every 60 seconds (ISR), even though the route is "static." Treating "static" as synonymous with "frozen forever" leads to unnecessary Dynamic Rendering opt-outs for freshness requirements ISR already satisfies.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Debugging by Assuming Only One Cache Layer Exists
When data appears stale, checking only the Data Cache (layer 2) and concluding "the tag revalidation worked, so caching isn't the problem" misses that the **client** Router Cache (layer 4) is an entirely separate, independently-timed layer that a correct server-side revalidation doesn't touch. Effective Next.js caching debugging means checking which of the four specific layers is actually serving the stale response, not treating "the cache" as one monolithic thing.
