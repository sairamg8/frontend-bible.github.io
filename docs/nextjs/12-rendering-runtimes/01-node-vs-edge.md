# ▲ Rendering Runtimes: Node.js vs Edge

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

Every Server Component, Route Handler, and Middleware executes in one of two fundamentally different JavaScript runtimes — a per-file (or per-segment) choice with real architectural consequences, not just a performance dial.

```
export const runtime = 'nodejs' (default)          export const runtime = 'edge'
        │                                                    │
        ▼                                                    ▼
Full Node.js runtime                              V8 isolate (same engine that powers
  - complete Node API surface (fs, crypto,           Cloudflare Workers/similar)
    net, full npm ecosystem compatibility)             - NO fs, limited crypto/net APIs
  - LARGER cold start (spinning up a full               - drastically smaller/faster cold start
    Node process/container)                              - runs in edge locations CLOSE to the user,
  - runs in one (or few) specific server regions            reducing network round-trip latency
```

### Why Edge Isn't Simply "Always Better"
The Edge runtime's restricted API surface (no direct filesystem access, a limited subset of Node's `crypto`, no arbitrary native npm package compatibility) means code that depends on Node-specific APIs or certain database drivers (many of which use raw TCP sockets, unavailable at the Edge) simply cannot run there — the choice is a genuine tradeoff between "lower latency, restricted capability" and "full capability, higher cold-start latency," not a strictly-superior option.

### Where Runtime Selection Matters Most
Middleware **always** runs on the Edge runtime (there's no opt-out) — this is precisely why Edge's restrictions (see [middleware](../08-middleware/01-edge-middleware.md)) are unavoidable there. Route Handlers and page rendering can each independently opt into `export const runtime = 'edge'` when their specific logic is Edge-compatible and would benefit from lower latency (e.g. a simple auth check or geo lookup), while a route doing heavy database ORM work or file processing stays on the Node.js default.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Global App Needing Fast Auth Checks Everywhere, But Full Database ORM Access for Complex Queries.
A SaaS app serves users worldwide and wants a lightweight session-validity check (reading a JWT from a cookie, verifying its signature) to execute with minimal latency regardless of the user's region — an ideal Edge runtime candidate, since it needs only `crypto.subtle` (Edge-compatible) and no database connection. The app's actual data-heavy API routes, however, use a full-featured ORM with a persistent connection pool that assumes Node's `net`/TCP stack — these stay on the default Node.js runtime, since porting that database access layer to Edge-compatible primitives isn't feasible without significant rework.

---

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```typescript
// app/api/verify-session/route.ts — Edge runtime: fast, JWT-only, no database dependency
export const runtime = 'edge';

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const token = request.headers.get('authorization')?.replace('Bearer ', '');
  if (!token) return new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 401 });

  const isValid = await verifyJwtSignature(token); // uses Web Crypto (crypto.subtle) — Edge-compatible
  return Response.json({ valid: isValid });
}
```

```typescript
// app/api/orders/route.ts — Node.js runtime (default): full ORM/connection-pool access
// export const runtime = 'nodejs'; ← this is the DEFAULT, no need to declare it explicitly

import { db } from '../../../lib/db'; // an ORM relying on a persistent TCP connection pool

export async function GET() {
  const orders = await db.query.orders.findMany({ with: { items: true, customer: true } });
  return Response.json(orders);
}
```

```typescript
// next.config.js — verifying which runtime a given route resolved to, during a build
// (Next.js prints a per-route runtime summary in the build output — worth checking after
// adding `export const runtime = 'edge'` anywhere, to confirm it actually took effect)
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Declaring `runtime = 'edge'` on a Route That Uses Node-Only APIs
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: this THROWS at runtime (or fails to build, depending on the specific API) —
// the ORM's underlying driver uses raw Node `net` sockets, unavailable in the Edge runtime
export const runtime = 'edge';
import { db } from '../../../lib/db'; // Node-only database driver
export async function GET() { return Response.json(await db.query.orders.findMany()); }

// ✅ CORRECT: verify every dependency in an Edge-targeted route is genuinely Edge-compatible
// BEFORE declaring the runtime — check the specific database driver's own Edge support docs
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Assuming Edge Is Always Faster in Absolute Terms
Edge's advantage is specifically **reduced network latency** (physically closer to the user) and **faster cold starts** — it does not make CPU-bound computation itself faster, and a V8 isolate's available memory/CPU budget is typically more constrained than a full Node.js server instance. A CPU-heavy operation (image processing, complex synchronous computation) may perform *worse* at the Edge under its tighter resource constraints, even though the network latency portion improved.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Forgetting Middleware's Edge Constraint Applies Even to Imported Utility Code
```typescript
// ❌ WRONG: middleware.ts itself doesn't use fs directly, but it imports a shared "utils" module
// that DOES (perhaps used elsewhere in a Node-runtime API route) — the shared import still
// gets bundled into middleware's Edge execution context and fails there
import { readConfigFile } from '../lib/shared-utils'; // shared-utils.ts uses fs internally
export function middleware() { readConfigFile(); }

// ✅ CORRECT: keep utility modules imported by middleware free of Node-only APIs, or split
// Edge-safe and Node-only utilities into clearly separate files
```
