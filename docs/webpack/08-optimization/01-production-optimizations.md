# ⚙️ Production Optimization: Minification, Tree Shaking & Scope Hoisting

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

`mode: 'production'` auto-enables a set of optimizations, each independently configurable under `optimization`.

```
Module Graph (post-bundling)
        │
        ├── Tree Shaking ──► usedExports analysis marks which named exports are ACTUALLY imported anywhere
        │                       (requires ESM syntax — CommonJS's dynamic require() can't be statically analyzed)
        │
        ├── concatenateModules (scope hoisting) ──► merges eligible modules into ONE function scope,
        │                                              eliminating per-module closure/wrapper overhead
        │
        └── TerserPlugin ──► minifies + dead-code-eliminates now-provably-unused branches (e.g. from DefinePlugin),
                                strips console.log/debugger if configured, runs in parallel worker processes
```

### Tree Shaking's Real Requirement: `sideEffects`
Tree shaking (`usedExports`) only marks *exports* as unused — it doesn't remove a module's top-level code unless Webpack can also prove the module has **no side effects** on import (no global CSS injection, no polyfill registration, no analytics beacon firing at import time). The `"sideEffects": false` flag in `package.json` is the explicit promise that lets Webpack safely drop an entire unused module, not just its unused exports — without it, tree shaking is meaningfully weaker.

### Module/Chunk IDs & Long-Term Caching
`optimization.moduleIds: 'deterministic'` assigns short, content-hash-derived numeric ids instead of the default incremental integers — incremental ids shift whenever an unrelated module is added/removed anywhere in the graph, invalidating content hashes (and therefore cache) for chunks that didn't actually change in content, only in id numbering.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A UI Library Import Pulling In the Entire Package Despite Only Using One Component.
`import { Button } from 'huge-ui-library'` was bundling the library's entire 400kb surface area, even though only `Button` was ever used. Root cause: the library's `package.json` was missing `"sideEffects": false`, so Webpack conservatively assumed importing it might trigger side effects (it didn't) and kept the whole module graph reachable from that import. Adding `"sideEffects": false` (verified safe — the library genuinely has no import-time side effects) let tree shaking eliminate the other 39 unused components, shrinking the bundle by ~350kb.

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```javascript
// webpack.config.js
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  optimization: {
    usedExports: true,           // enables tree-shaking analysis
    moduleIds: 'deterministic',    // stable ids across builds — preserves content-hash cache validity
    concatenateModules: true,       // scope hoisting — merges modules into fewer function wrappers
    minimize: true,
    minimizer: [
      new TerserPlugin({
        parallel: true, // spread minification across CPU cores
        terserOptions: {
          compress: { drop_console: true, drop_debugger: true },
          format: { comments: false },
        },
        extractComments: false,
      }),
    ],
  },
};
```

```json
// package.json — the promise that unlocks full tree shaking for this package
{
  "name": "@acme/ui-kit",
  "sideEffects": ["*.css"],
}
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: `"sideEffects": false` on a Package That Actually Has Import-Time Side Effects
```json
// ❌ DANGEROUS: if this package registers a global (e.g. a polyfill, or CSS custom properties)
// at import time, declaring "sideEffects": false lets Webpack silently DROP that module entirely
// when none of its named exports are used — breaking the polyfill/CSS at runtime with no build error
{ "sideEffects": false }

// ✅ CORRECT: list the specific files that DO have side effects (commonly CSS imports) explicitly
{ "sideEffects": ["*.css", "./src/polyfills/intersection-observer.js"] }
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: CommonJS Imports Defeating Tree Shaking Entirely
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: require() is dynamic by nature — Webpack cannot statically prove which exports are used
const { Button } = require('huge-ui-library');

// ✅ CORRECT: static ESM import syntax is what tree-shaking analysis actually requires
import { Button } from 'huge-ui-library';
```
Even with `"sideEffects": false` set correctly, a CommonJS-authored library (or a CommonJS import syntax on the consuming side) caps how much tree shaking can actually achieve, since `usedExports` analysis fundamentally depends on statically-analyzable ESM `import`/`export` syntax.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Blanket `drop_console: true` Silencing Legitimate Production Error Logging
Stripping all `console.*` calls in production removes genuine `console.error` calls a monitoring/error-tracking setup might rely on for capturing unhandled exceptions client-side. Scope Terser's `pure_funcs` to specifically target `console.log`/`console.debug` (development-only chatter) while explicitly preserving `console.error`/`console.warn`, rather than a blanket `drop_console`.
