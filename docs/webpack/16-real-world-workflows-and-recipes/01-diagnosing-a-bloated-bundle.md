# ⚙️ Diagnosing and Shrinking a Bloated Production Bundle, End-to-End

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

"The bundle got big" is a symptom with four genuinely different, common root causes — and the treemap from `webpack-bundle-analyzer` (see the [performance analysis doc](../14-performance-analysis/01-diagnostics-and-bundle-analysis.md)) is the starting point for distinguishing between them, not a fix by itself:

```text
Treemap box you're looking at                    →  Likely category & fix
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Same library name, TWO boxes, different sizes     →  Duplicate dependency (Step 2)
ONE library, but way bigger than its own docs      →  Missing sideEffects / barrel-import
claim it should be                                    over-inclusion (Step 3)
A box you don't even recognize as a real            →  A transitive dependency pulled in
dependency you use directly                            by something else (Step 4)
Large "vendors" chunk with many small,               →  Legacy transpile target shipping
similar-looking polyfill-shaped entries                 unnecessary polyfills (Step 5)
```

Each category has a completely different fix — spending time minifying/compressing harder when the actual problem is a duplicated dependency wastes effort on the wrong layer entirely.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Bundle That Grew 40% Over Two Months With No Single Obvious Cause.
`performance.hints` wasn't wired into CI (a known gap the team had been meaning to fix), so a gradual 40% growth in the main entrypoint went unnoticed until a stakeholder complained about slow load times on a conference demo network. Rather than guessing, the team ran `ANALYZE=true` and worked the treemap systematically: found one clearly duplicated charting library (two major versions coexisting), one UI library missing `sideEffects: false` pulling in far more than its actually-used components, and confirmed the remaining growth was legitimate new feature code — not a bug, just genuinely new functionality. Fixing the first two recovered roughly 30% of the growth without touching a single line of feature code.

---

## 3. Production-Grade Diagnostic Sequence

```bash
# Step 1: generate the treemap — the starting point for every category below
ANALYZE=true yarn build
```

```javascript
// Step 2: DUPLICATE DEPENDENCY — confirm via the treemap (two same-named boxes), then verify
// via the actual dependency tree, not just a guess
```
```bash
npm ls react-chart-lib
# react-chart-lib@3.2.0
# └─┬ some-other-dep@1.4.0
#   └── react-chart-lib@2.8.0   <- a SECOND, older copy, pulled in transitively
```
```javascript
// FIX: force every import of the package to resolve to the SAME single instance —
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      'react-chart-lib': require.resolve('react-chart-lib'), // pins ALL resolutions to one copy
    },
  },
};
```

```json
// Step 3: MISSING sideEffects — confirm the library's OWN package.json is the actual gap
// (from the huge-ui-library scenario — see the production optimizations doc for the mechanics)
{
  "name": "huge-ui-library",
  "sideEffects": false
}
```
```javascript
// If you can't fix the library's own package.json (a third-party dependency), override it
// locally instead — this tells YOUR build's tree-shaking to trust it has no side effects,
// verified true by you, without needing the upstream package to publish the fix itself
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /node_modules\/huge-ui-library/, sideEffects: false },
    ],
  },
};
```

```bash
# Step 4: AN UNRECOGNIZED TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY — trace WHY it's included at all
npm ls moment
# app@1.0.0
# └─┬ some-date-picker@2.1.0
#   └── moment@2.29.4   <- app code never imports moment directly; this date picker does
```
```text
FIX options, in order of preference:
1. Check if the dependency (some-date-picker) has a lighter alternative or a newer version
   that dropped the moment dependency (many libraries have migrated away from it).
2. If moment is unavoidable and only used for one specific thing internally, check whether
   the dependency exposes a way to inject a lighter date library instead.
3. As a last resort, moment itself ships locale files that bloat it further — if truly stuck
   with it, exclude unused locales via moment's own webpack plugin rather than accepting the
   full multi-locale bundle by default.
```

```bash
# Step 5: LEGACY TRANSPILE TARGET shipping unnecessary polyfills — check the actual target
cat .browserslistrc
# > 0.5%, last 5 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead    <- "last 5 versions" of EVERY browser
#                                                        including long-dead ones is far broader
#                                                        than almost any real user base needs
```
```text
# FIX: narrow the target to the ACTUAL supported browser matrix (check real analytics,
# not a copy-pasted default) — modern-only targets need dramatically fewer polyfills
# and less transpiled (larger) output for the same source syntax
> 0.5%, last 2 versions, not dead, not ie 11
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Fixing the First Big Box Without Checking If It's Legitimate
Not every large treemap box is a bug — a genuinely feature-rich charting library your app actually uses extensively can legitimately be large. Compare the box's size against that library's own documented minified/gzip size for the features you use; if they roughly match, that's real, necessary weight, not bloat. Chase the boxes that are surprisingly large relative to what you'd expect, not just the biggest ones in absolute terms.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Fixing `sideEffects` Globally Instead of Per-Package
```javascript
// ❌ DANGEROUS: setting this in YOUR OWN package.json as a blanket "false" is a promise about
// YOUR ENTIRE codebase having no side effects anywhere — if even one file does (a global CSS
// import, a polyfill registration), tree shaking can now silently DROP code you actually need
{ "sideEffects": false } // applied carelessly to your OWN app's package.json

// ✅ CORRECT: verify true per-package before setting it — either upstream in a dependency's own
// package.json, or scoped narrowly via a webpack module rule targeting just that dependency
// (Step 3 above), never as an unverified blanket claim about your whole application
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Declaring Victory From the Uncompressed Treemap Number
```text
❌ A treemap box showing "180kb" by default is PARSED (uncompressed) size — the actual
wire-transfer cost to a real user is the GZIP/BROTLI size, often 3-4x smaller for text-heavy
JS, and the two numbers can lead to very different prioritization decisions

✅ CORRECT: toggle the analyzer's gzip size view (or check against real compressed build
output) before deciding a specific finding is actually worth the engineering time to fix
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 4: Not Adding a Regression Guard After Fixing the Bloat
Fixing today's bloat without wiring `performance.hints: 'error'` (or a dedicated CI size-limit step) into the pipeline means the exact same gradual-creep problem from the scenario above recurs — the fix addressed the symptom for this moment, not the absence of a tripwire that would have caught it three weeks in instead of two months in.
