# 📖 Advanced Patterns: Living Style Guide, PR-Based Visual Review & Outside-In Development

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

At its most mature, Storybook usage isn't just "a tool for viewing components" — it becomes the organizing principle for how a team actually **builds** UI, shifting development from "wire it into the real app first, then figure out its states" to the reverse.

```
Inside-out development (traditional):           Outside-in / Component-Driven development:
  build the FULL app FEATURE first                  build the COMPONENT in isolation FIRST
  (routing, data-fetching, real backend)              (via Storybook stories, covering every
        │                                               state: empty/loading/error/populated)
        ▼                                                     │
  component emerges as a BY-PRODUCT,                          ▼
  often under-specified for edge cases              WIRE the already-verified component into
  the "happy path" feature build never                the real app's routing/data LAST —
  happened to exercise                                  integration is the final step, not the first
```

### Storybook as a Living Style Guide
Because every component's stories are directly tied to its actual, current source code (not a separately-maintained style guide document that drifts), Storybook becomes an always-accurate answer to "what components exist, and what are their valid states" — the living, authoritative alternative to a static design guideline PDF that inevitably falls out of sync with the real, evolving component library.

### PR-Based Visual + Interaction Review as a Merge Gate
Combining Chromatic (visual regression) and the test-runner (interaction/behavioral regression) as required CI checks means a PR literally **cannot merge** if it introduces an unreviewed visual change or breaks a documented interaction — component quality becomes an enforced gate, not a "hopefully someone notices in code review" hope.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Team Fully Adopting Outside-In Development for a New Checkout Feature, Catching Edge Cases Before Integration.
A team building a new checkout summary component started by writing its stories FIRST — `Empty`, `SingleItem`, `MultipleItems`, `WithDiscount`, `OutOfStock`, each with real, hand-crafted mock data covering that specific state — before writing a single line of the actual page/routing/data-fetching integration code. This outside-in approach surfaced several edge cases (how does the discount badge render with a very long promo code string? what happens visually with 15+ line items?) that would likely have gone unnoticed in a traditional "build the happy path first" approach, since those specific states might never have been naturally exercised during initial feature development — only appearing much later, in production, for a real user who happened to hit that exact edge case.

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```tsx
// CheckoutSummary.stories.tsx — written BEFORE the real page/routing integration exists at all
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';
import { CheckoutSummary } from './CheckoutSummary';

const meta: Meta<typeof CheckoutSummary> = { component: CheckoutSummary, title: 'Checkout/CheckoutSummary', tags: ['autodocs'] };
export default meta;
type Story = StoryObj<typeof CheckoutSummary>;

export const Empty: Story = { args: { items: [] } };
export const SingleItem: Story = { args: { items: [{ name: 'Widget', price: 19.99, quantity: 1 }] } };
export const WithLongPromoCode: Story = {
  args: { items: [{ name: 'Widget', price: 19.99, quantity: 1 }], promoCode: 'SUMMER-MEGA-DISCOUNT-2026-EXTRA-LONG' },
}; // an edge case discovered specifically BY authoring stories systematically, before any real integration
export const ManyItems: Story = { args: { items: Array.from({ length: 15 }, (_, i) => ({ name: `Item ${i}`, price: 9.99, quantity: 1 })) } };
export const OutOfStock: Story = { args: { items: [{ name: 'Widget', price: 19.99, quantity: 1, inStock: false }] } };
```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml — visual + interaction regression as REQUIRED, merge-blocking checks
jobs:
  chromatic:
    # ... (visual regression, from the visual testing doc)
  storybook-tests:
    # ... (interaction regression via test-runner, from the testing integration doc)
# Both jobs configured as REQUIRED status checks in the repo's branch protection rules —
# a PR literally cannot merge with an unreviewed visual diff or a failing interaction test
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Treating Component-Driven Development as "Storybook Adoption" Alone, Without the Workflow Shift
```
❌ INCOMPLETE: simply having Storybook installed and some stories written doesn't
automatically produce the benefits of outside-in development — if the TEAM'S actual
process still starts with wiring components into the real app first, and stories are
written AFTERWARD as an afterthought documentation step, the edge-case-discovery
benefit of building components in isolation FIRST never actually materializes

✅ CORRECT: the workflow ORDER matters — stories/isolated component development
genuinely needs to happen BEFORE real-app integration for the outside-in benefits to apply
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Making Visual/Interaction Checks Required Gates Without a Clear Review Ownership Process
```
❌ RISKY: turning Chromatic/test-runner checks into REQUIRED, merge-blocking gates
without a clear process for WHO reviews/approves visual diffs can create a bottleneck —
PRs stuck waiting for a visual review that no one has clear ownership of approving

✅ CORRECT: pair merge-blocking visual/interaction gates with an EXPLICIT process
(a designated reviewer role, a documented SLA for visual review turnaround) so the
gate protects quality without becoming an unowned bottleneck
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Writing Stories That Don't Reflect Genuinely Realistic Data/Edge Cases
The value of outside-in development depends entirely on stories covering GENUINELY realistic edge cases (real-world long strings, real boundary conditions, real error shapes) — a set of stories using only clean, idealized sample data (`'Item'`, `$9.99`, always exactly 2 items) provides much less edge-case-discovery value than stories deliberately incorporating the messy, awkward real-world data variations (very long names, unusual prices, empty/single/many-item boundary cases) that actually tend to break UI in production.
