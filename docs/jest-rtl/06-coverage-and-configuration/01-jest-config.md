# 🧪 Coverage & Configuration: `jest.config.js`, Thresholds & Transform Pipeline

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

`jest.config.js` controls test **discovery**, **environment simulation**, **module resolution during tests**, and **coverage enforcement** — several genuinely independent concerns bundled into one config file.

```
jest.config.js
        │
        ├── testEnvironment: 'jsdom' | 'node'   ──► simulates a DOM (component tests) vs bare Node (pure logic/backend tests)
        ├── setupFiles / setupFilesAfterEach       ──► global test setup, e.g. importing jest-dom's custom matchers
        ├── moduleNameMapper                          ──► mocking CSS/asset imports, resolving path aliases DURING tests
        ├── transform                                    ──► babel-jest/ts-jest/swc pipeline — how source files become
        │                                                     runnable JS for Jest specifically
        └── collectCoverage / coverageThreshold             ──► enforcing MINIMUM coverage percentages, failing the run
                                                                  if actual coverage falls below the configured threshold
```

### `testEnvironment`: Simulating a DOM, or Not
Jest itself runs in Node — `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` layers a simulated DOM (via the `jsdom` library) on top, providing `document`/`window`/etc. for component tests that need them. `testEnvironment: 'node'` (no DOM simulation) is faster and more appropriate for pure logic/utility function tests that never touch the DOM at all — mismatching this (using `jsdom` for pure-logic tests, or `node` for component tests) either wastes setup overhead or causes tests needing DOM APIs to fail outright.

### `moduleNameMapper`: Mocking Non-JS Imports and Resolving Aliases
Jest, unlike a bundler, has no native understanding of CSS Modules or asset imports (`.css`, `.svg`) — `moduleNameMapper` redirects these imports to a mock/stub module during tests (since a component test rarely cares about actual CSS content, just that the import doesn't crash), and separately mirrors any bundler-side path aliases (`@/components/...`) so tests resolve the same aliases the actual app build does — the same "must be kept in sync manually" relationship covered in the [Vite path resolution doc](../../vite/12-path-resolution-and-aliases/01-resolve-options.md).

### `coverageThreshold`: An Enforced, CI-Blocking Floor
```javascript
coverageThreshold: {
  global: { branches: 80, functions: 80, lines: 80, statements: 80 },
}
```
Setting this makes `jest --coverage` **fail** (non-zero exit code) if actual coverage drops below the configured percentage for any listed metric — turning "we should maintain good coverage" from an aspiration into an enforced, CI-blocking gate.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A CSS Module Import Crashing Every Component Test Until `moduleNameMapper` Was Configured.
A team importing `import styles from './Button.module.css'` in component source code found every test importing that component crashing with `Cannot find module './Button.module.css' from 'Button.tsx'` — Jest has no CSS-handling capability of its own, unlike the actual Vite/Webpack build. Configuring `moduleNameMapper` to redirect any `\.module\.css$` import to a simple identity-proxy mock (returning the class name as both key and value) resolved the crash immediately, letting tests import CSS-Module-using components without Jest ever needing to understand CSS at all.

---

## 3. Production-Grade Code Example

```javascript
// jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom', // this project tests React components, needs document/window

  setupFilesAfterEach: ['<rootDir>/src/test-setup.ts'], // imports jest-dom matchers globally

  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.module\\.css$': 'identity-obj-proxy', // { button: 'button' } — mimics CSS Modules' shape without real CSS
    '\\.(jpg|png|svg)$': '<rootDir>/src/test-utils/fileMock.js', // stub — tests don't need REAL asset content
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1', // MUST mirror the actual app's path alias (vite.config.ts/tsconfig.json)
  },

  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': ['babel-jest', { presets: ['@babel/preset-typescript', '@babel/preset-react'] }],
  },

  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: { branches: 75, functions: 80, lines: 80, statements: 80 },
  },
};
```

```typescript
// src/test-setup.ts — global setup, imported via setupFilesAfterEach
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'; // adds toBeInTheDocument(), toHaveClass(), etc. as global matchers
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Using `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'` for Pure-Logic Tests
```javascript
// ❌ SUBOPTIMAL: simulating a full DOM for tests that never touch document/window adds
// meaningful setup overhead per test file, slowing down a test suite that gains nothing from it
// jest.config.js: testEnvironment: 'jsdom' — applied globally, even to pure utility function tests

// ✅ CORRECT: use per-file overrides (a docblock comment) or split config projects so pure-logic
// tests use the faster 'node' environment, reserving 'jsdom' for genuinely component-level tests
/** @jest-environment node */
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: `moduleNameMapper` Drifting Out of Sync With the Actual Bundler's Alias Config
```javascript
// ❌ RISKY: exactly the same drift problem covered in the Vite/TypeScript config docs —
// a path alias added to vite.config.ts/tsconfig.json but forgotten in Jest's moduleNameMapper
// works in the app but breaks in tests with "Cannot find module '@/newFeature'"
moduleNameMapper: { '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1' }, // must be updated EVERY time the real alias config changes

// ✅ AWARENESS: this is precisely the class of problem Vitest's shared-config design
// (see the Vite testing integration doc) eliminates — worth considering for NEW projects,
// though migrating an established Jest suite is its own separate cost/benefit decision
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: Chasing 100% Coverage as a Goal Rather Than a Signal
```
❌ RISKY: a coverageThreshold set to 100% often pressures engineers into writing tests that
merely EXECUTE code paths (satisfying the coverage tool) without actually asserting anything
meaningful about behavior — "coverage theater" that inflates the metric without genuinely
protecting against regressions

✅ CORRECT: treat coverage thresholds as a FLOOR catching obviously-untested code, not a
target to maximize for its own sake — a lower, honestly-enforced threshold with genuinely
meaningful assertions beats a 100% threshold met with hollow, assertion-free tests
```
