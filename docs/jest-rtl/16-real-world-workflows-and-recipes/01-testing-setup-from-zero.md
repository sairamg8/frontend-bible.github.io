# 🧪 Wiring Up a Testing Environment From Zero in an Existing Project

## 1. Under-The-Hood Mechanics

An existing, previously-untested project doesn't need Jest, RTL, `jest-dom`, and MSW configured all at once as one big-bang setup — each piece solves a genuinely separate problem, and adding them in **dependency order** means every intermediate step is itself a working, runnable state, not a half-configured pile you can't test until everything is done:

```text
1. Jest itself           ──► can run a test file at all, executes plain JS/TS assertions
2. testEnvironment/       ──► can render REACT COMPONENTS (jsdom gives document/window;
   transform pipeline          the transform makes JSX/TS actually compile for Jest)
3. @testing-library/react ──► can query/interact with rendered component output
4. jest-dom               ──► can write READABLE assertions (toBeInTheDocument(), not
                                manual DOM property poking)
5. MSW                    ──► can test components that actually FETCH data, without
                                hitting a real network
```

Each layer is independently testable the moment it's added — you can (and should) verify layer 1 works before adding layer 2, rather than writing config for all five and debugging a wall of errors with no idea which layer is actually broken.

## 2. Real-World Engineering Scenario

**Scenario**: A Two-Year-Old App With Zero Tests, Where a Recent Production Bug Justified Finally Adding Them.
A team's app shipped for two years with no test suite at all — "we'll add tests eventually" never got prioritized against feature work, until a regression that a basic component test would have caught reached production and got noticed by customers. The team doesn't attempt "write tests for everything" as one initiative; they wire up the minimum working test infrastructure first (verified against ONE trivial test), then write a real test for the exact component that regressed, proving the setup works end-to-end on a real, non-trivial case before asking the rest of the team to start adding tests to their own PRs.

## 3. Production-Grade Setup Sequence

```bash
# Step 1: Jest itself — verify it runs BEFORE adding anything React-specific
npm install --save-dev jest @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-typescript @babel/preset-react babel-jest
```

```javascript
// babel.config.js — needed for babel-jest to understand JSX/TS at all
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@babel/preset-env', '@babel/preset-typescript', '@babel/preset-react'],
};
```

```javascript
// A throwaway sanity-check test — confirms Jest itself works before adding ANY React pieces
// src/sanity.test.ts
test('jest runs', () => {
  expect(1 + 1).toBe(2);
});
```

```bash
npx jest src/sanity.test.ts   # MUST pass before moving to Step 2 — if this fails, the
                                # problem is Jest/Babel config, not React/RTL/anything downstream
```

```bash
# Step 2: jsdom environment + React Testing Library — now render an ACTUAL component
npm install --save-dev jest-environment-jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom
```

```javascript
// jest.config.js — minimal, just enough for component rendering
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  transform: { '^.+\\.[jt]sx?$': 'babel-jest' },
};
```

```tsx
// A second sanity check — proves rendering + querying works before adding jest-dom's nicer matchers
// src/Button.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

function Button({ label }: { label: string }) {
  return <button>{label}</button>;
}

test('renders a button with the given label', () => {
  render(<Button label="Save" />);
  expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })).toBeTruthy(); // plain assertion — no jest-dom yet
});
```

```bash
# Step 3: jest-dom — upgrades assertions from "toBeTruthy()" to purpose-built, readable matchers
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/jest-dom
```

```typescript
// src/test-setup.ts — imported globally so EVERY test file gets jest-dom's matchers automatically
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

```javascript
// jest.config.js — wire the setup file in
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  transform: { '^.+\\.[jt]sx?$': 'babel-jest' },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/src/test-setup.ts'],
};
```

```tsx
// Now the SAME test can use a real jest-dom matcher — more readable, better failure messages
expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Save' })).toBeInTheDocument();
```

```bash
# Step 4: MSW — only needed once you're testing something that ACTUALLY fetches data
npm install --save-dev msw
```

```typescript
// src/mocks/server.ts — one shared MSW server for the whole suite's happy-path responses
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
import { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw';

export const server = setupServer(
  http.get('/api/users/:id', ({ params }) => {
    return HttpResponse.json({ id: params.id, name: 'Alex' });
  })
);
```

```typescript
// src/test-setup.ts — extend the SAME setup file from Step 3, don't create a second one
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import { server } from './mocks/server';

beforeAll(() => server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'error' }));
afterEach(() => server.resetHandlers());
afterAll(() => server.close());
```

## 4. Senior Engineer Edge Cases & Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Pitfall 1: Configuring All Five Layers Before Running a Single Test
Writing the complete `jest.config.js` (transform, moduleNameMapper, MSW, coverage thresholds) up front, THEN running tests for the first time, means any failure could be caused by any of five independent pieces — debugging becomes guesswork. Verifying each layer in isolation (Step 1's plain sanity test, Step 2's render-only test) before adding the next means a failure always has exactly one new suspect: whatever you just added.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 2: Skipping Straight to MSW for a Component That Doesn't Need It
```tsx
// ❌ OVER-ENGINEERED: this component takes data as a prop — it never fetches anything itself,
// so there's no network activity for MSW to intercept, and setting it up here adds nothing
function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
test('renders user name', () => {
  render(<UserCard user={{ name: 'Alex' }} />); // no fetch happening — MSW is irrelevant here
});

// ✅ CORRECT: reserve MSW setup for components that ACTUALLY call fetch/axios themselves
// (e.g. a component using useQuery/useEffect to load its own data) — not every component needs it
```

### ⚠️ Pitfall 3: One Test File's `jest.mock()` Silently Affecting Sibling Test Files
Module-level mocks (`jest.mock('../api/client')`) are scoped per test **file**, not globally leaked across files — but a shared `test-setup.ts` `beforeEach`/`afterEach` IS global, applying to every test file in the suite. Putting something test-specific (a per-test-suite mock reset that only one feature's tests actually need) into the shared setup file affects every unrelated test file's timing/behavior — keep the shared setup file to genuinely universal concerns (jest-dom matchers, the MSW server lifecycle), and put anything narrower in the specific test file or a `describe` block's own `beforeEach`.

### ⚠️ Pitfall 4: Forgetting `onUnhandledRequest: 'error'` and Getting False-Positive Passes
```typescript
// ❌ RISKY: without this option, MSW's default behavior on an unmatched request is to
// let it through (attempting a REAL network call in a test environment) or warn quietly —
// a component silently fetching the WRONG url can pass a test that never actually
// verified the right request was made
server.listen(); // default onUnhandledRequest behavior — doesn't fail loudly on a mismatch

// ✅ CORRECT: fail loudly on any request without a matching handler — this turns
// "the component requested the wrong endpoint" into an immediate, visible test failure
// instead of a silently-passing test that never proved what it looked like it proved
server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'error' });
```
